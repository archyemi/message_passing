I decomposed the API into several microservices listed below:
- Persons API microservices
- Connections API microservices
- Locations REST API microservices
- Locations gRPC API microservices
- Strimzi Kafka Cluster
- Locations data consumer microservices

The Kafka cluster will be used to orchestrate and store location data.
The Locations microservice handles alot of data so i have used kafka to decouple it from the backend so it can scale.

REST and gRPC API were created for the locations service to provide options for clients based on their preferences.
REST was created because it is the industry standard and a lot of clients will be familiar with it.
gRPC was created to provide better perfomance for any client ready to interface with it.
