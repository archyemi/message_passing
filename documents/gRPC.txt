The gRPC API has two methods, which are:
- Get
- Create

The Get endpoint allows a client retrieve location details
The Create endpoint allows a client create a new location

I added two scripts to test the functionality of the two methods

To call the Get method, run:

python modules/api-location-svc-gRPC/getter.py

 To call the Create method, run:

python modules/api-location-svc-gRPC/writer.py
